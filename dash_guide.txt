A quick note:
  The command "app.run_server(debug=True)" won't run on Jupyter Notebook.
  
  So if you're using Jupyter Notebook as your Python environment, then you need to download your code as a Python file (.py)
  and execute it as shown in the tutorial (e.g.: python app.py).
  
  The visualizations can be viewed on your web browser on http://127.0.0.1:8050/
