Installation step-by-step:

Step 1: Install RISE
Command line: conda install -c damianavila82 rise
Note:
If you’re using a virtual environment, don’t forget to activate it first and then install RISE

Step 2: Shutdown Kernels
Open new notebook. You should be able to see 2 new things
1. Click on View > Cell Toolbar > Slideshow
You will see on each cell on the upper right corner a drop-down tab with these options: (Slide, sub-slide, Fragment, Skip, Notes)
2. A new icon appeared next to the keyboard (command palette). The new icon is how you will execute/launch the slideshow. It looks like a histogram chart.

Step 3 (Optional):
If you can’t find the new icon.
Restart your computer and launch Jupyter again.
